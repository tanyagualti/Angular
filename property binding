 It uses square brackets [] to bind a component property to an element property.
 <div class="container">
	<input type="text" name="n1" value={{data}} disabled={{disable}}> //interpolation
	<br><br>
	<input type="text" name="n2" [value]=data [disabled]= disable> //property binding
</div>
# .ts file
 data="peter";
  disable=false;

//jb distable property ko true kra toh interpolation and property binding dono disable ho gye 
but jb false kra toh property binding toh false ho gyi  aur interpolation n false ko string smjh liya aur disabled false nhi hua
toh diff saf hai interpolation mainly html tag k innner data ko change krne k liye use hota hai
aur property binding property ki value change krne k liye use hoti hai


diff between both
Property Binding: Used to bind data to an element property (e.g., attributes, DOM properties).
Interpolation: Used to bind data to the inner text content of an element.


Property Binding: Can bind data to various properties of elements, such as src, href, disabled, etc.
Interpolation: Primarily used for binding text content.
