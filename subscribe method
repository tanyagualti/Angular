subscribe method which is use with observable 
subscribe method exist in rsjx library

# i try to use that code but this is wrong
value:Subscription=this.translationService.loadLanguage(this.language).subscribe();
     this.translationService.setTraslations(this.language,this.value);


     Use of Callbacks: The subscribe method's first argument is a callback function that receives the
     data emitted by the observable, which you should use to set the translations.

     we have to use call back function as a argument for receive the data of observerable
     # correct code
     this.translationService.loadLanguage(this.language).subscribe(
  (translations) => {
    this.translationService.setTranslations(this.language, translations);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error('Error loading language:', error);
  }
);
