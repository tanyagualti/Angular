uses of ngModel

1.Two-Way Data Binding: ngModel simplifies the process of binding a form input element to a property in the component class. It automatically 
updates the property when the user changes the input, and vice versa, which reduces the need for manual synchronization.
syntax:[(ngModel)]
//jese jese input me value likhte rhnge vese vese h1 me value inc dec hoti rhegi
example:<form #myForms="ngForm">
	
	<input type="text" name="name" [(ngModel)]="name">//form control 
	<h1>{{name}}</h1> 
	<br><br>
	<input type="email" name="email" ngModel>
	<br><br>
	<input type="submit" name="submit">
</form>



ngModel is a directive used for two-way data binding between form inputs and component properties.

Creating Form Controls with ngModel:

ngModel is used to bind form controls (like inputs, selects, etc.) to component properties. 
It creates an instance of a form control and tracks its value and validation status.
 <input type="text" id="name" [(ngModel)]="name" name="name" required>



Template Reference Variable (#myForm):

When you use a template reference variable (e.g., #myForm) on a <form> element with ngForm, 
it creates an instance of the form and allows you to access the form's overall state and controls.
<form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(myForm)">

Accessing Form Controls:

The template reference variable (#myForm) is used to access the form instance
and its controls from within the template and the component.
This allows you to manage and interact with the form and its controls programmatically.
