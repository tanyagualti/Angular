an effective loading strategy is a key to sucessfull single page application.
a module can be loaded eagerly,lazily nad preloaded

eager loading: all the modules and functions are loaded on application startup.(yeh sare modules and functionalities ko
application stratup me hi load kr deta hai. jese hi user website k url ko hit krta hai vese hi sare module comonent srevices pipes
sb kuch load ho jata hai ek sath hi isse apka application slow ho jata hai)

if we are use routes and then you are not using any loading that means you use eager loading.
bydefault loading is eager loading.
eager loading is ok in small app but not in big























lazy loading:loading modules on demand

preloading: is loading module in background just after application start
