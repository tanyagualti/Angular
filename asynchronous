asynchronous loading of data refers to the process of loading data in the background, without blocking the execution of 
other tasks.in other words data is loaded in non blocking manner,allowing the application to continue executing other tasks
while the data is being loaded.

(observable ko hmesha tb use krte hai jb asynchronous data load and handle krna ho)
1. when data is fetch from api or server then we use observable (for asynchronous data handling)
2. we use observable  in preloaded modules to handle the asynchronous loading of data.
preloading modules is technique used to load modules in the background before they are actually needed,to improve the 
performance and user experience of an application.

when we use observables in preloading modules , we can

--> load data asynchronously in the background
--> handle error and retries
--> use operators to transform and manipulate the data
--> use the async pipe to render the data in the template


for asynchronour we use async pipe,observable,promises,subscribe

third line pr server ko request bhejne ka code likha hua tha aur filhal vo request server k pass gyi aur baki code 
execute hona stop ho gya aur vo tb tk stop nhi hoga jb tk response n aa jaye so thst is not efficient

httpclient introduce hua yeh problem solve krne k liye vo obervale ko yha rkh deta hai aur vo obervable sare req and response
ko observe krta hai mtlb sara req res ka data obervable apne pass rkhta hai..

response object
and 
request object  are observables which means they can hold multiple values over time.

the observable contains information about the request such as url,headers and body
the observable contains information about the response such as status code,headers,and body



if we want to use this obervable holding data ... then we can use subscribe method and async pipe?
thats correct,
