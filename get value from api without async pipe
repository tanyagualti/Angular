important note:observable type is used to represent asyynchronous data streams.

//make a service file and write the code
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; //The HttpClient service in Angular is used to make HTTP requests to a backend server.(it provides http services)
import {Observable} from 'rxjs'; //generally  An Observable is like a collection that arrives over time.(yeh values ko collect krke rkh leta hai immediately value provide nhi krata)
import {Doctor} from '../interfaces/doctor'; //its a custom interface making by me

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})

export class IntrfaceService {


constructor(private http:HttpClient){} //here make the instance of httpClient which helps to fetch the method get 

getData():Observable<Doctor[]>{  //when you use Type observable then you are telling angular that the getData() method returns an obervable  . <Doctor[]> that indicates the type of data that the observable emits.in this case,its an array of book objects
     return this.http.get<Doctor[]>('http://localhost:3000/doctor'); //when you subscribe to the observable return by getData(),you can expect to receive an array of book objects
}

}




//register.component.ts

import { Component, OnInit ,OnDestroy} from '@angular/core';
import { Doctor } from '../../interfaces/doctor';
import { IntrfaceService } from '../../services/intrface.service'; //import the above service bcz we have to use method of this service and show into this component template
import {Observable,,Subscription} from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-register',
  templateUrl: './register.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./register.component.css']
})
export class RegisterComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private service:IntrfaceService) {} //make the instance of service which helps to call the method



//content$ me abhi koi value nhi dali hui toh error show hogi it is not initialize so hum ! mark use krnge aur exclamation mark yeh btana hai ki future me definately yha value dalegi(!:: Tells TypeScript that the property will definitely be assigned a value before it's used, even though it's not initialized immediately.)
  content$!:Observable<Doctor[]>; //This is the name of the property. The dollar sign ($) is a common naming convention in Angular (and in reactive programming in general) to indicate that the variable is an Observable. This is not required but is a useful convention to signal that content$ will not hold a static value but an Observable.
  doctors:Doctor[]=[]; //we make an variable which contain the array and type is doctor
  subscription!:Subscription;   //that is varibale type is subscription 
bcz hme unsubscribe krna hai toh hme isi type k varible ki jrurt pdegi


  ngOnInit(): void {
    
       this.content$=this.service.getData();    //getData returns an observable and obviously this data hold only observable variable that is $content
      this.subscription =  this.content$.subscribe((result)=>{      //that observable need to subscribe and there result(data) is in array form 
       this.doctors = result;  //so result data assign in array doctor variable
       })
  }
ngOnDestroy():void{
if(this.subscription){
  this.subscription.unsubscribe(); //unsubscribe the subscribe (This is important for preventing memory leaks, )A memory leak in programming refers to a situation where a computer program retains memory that is no longer needed, causing it to consume more memory than necessary.
}
}
}



register.component.html

<div *ngFor="let val of doctors">
     <p>{{val.name}}</p>
</div>


//it all works correct but without async pipe (but this code becomes too lengthy bcz all code of subscribe written manually)

//but in async pipe its done automatically (subscribe desubscribe all)
