two way binding: means same time pr property ko update krwana aur display krwana that is two way binding.it is acheive through ngModel

we have to import formModule in app.compoenent.ts otherwise got error and also register in imports

example:

name:string="";
<form #myForms="ngForm">
	
	<input type="text" name="name" [(ngModel)]="name">//form control 
	<h1>{{name}}</h1> 
	<br><br>
	<input type="email" name="email" ngModel>
	<br><br>
	<input type="submit" name="submit">
</form>

//other way is also here acheiving two way binding but its very lengthy :-make a function and use onchange event
//property is name in this example [(ngModel)]="name" ngmodel k sath is trh s use krne ko khnge binding

isse update bhi ho gya aur display bhi ho gya (two way)
