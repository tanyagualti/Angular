  this.display = !this.display;

working of this(  this.display = !this.display;)

this.display is a boolean variable, meaning it can be either true or false.
The ! operator is the logical NOT operator in JavaScript. It inverts the value of a boolean.
If this.display is true, !this.display will be false.
If this.display is false, !this.display will be true.
By assigning !this.display back to this.display, you effectively toggle its value.
So, each time this.display = !this.display; is executed:

If this.display was true, it becomes false.
If this.display was false, it becomes true.




working of this(his.display = this.display ? false : true;):
